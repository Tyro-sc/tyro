== Philosophy

Tyro is a strongly opinionated tool. There is no anonymous "WebElement". Everything needs to be a *COMPONENT*.
Tyro is a typed UI component tool.

In the previous sample the line:
[source, groovy]
-----------------------------------------------------
TextField search = $('#lst-ib') as InputTypeText
-----------------------------------------------------
expressed that we try to find an *HTML5 input of type text with id: 'lst-ib'* but we want to use it
as a formal TextField

The associated imports are :
[source, groovy]
-----------------------------------------------------
import sc.tyro.core.component.field.TextField
import sc.tyro.bundle.html5.input.InputTypeText
-----------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
(TODO : a discuter) The challenge is to avoid imports on a bundle (everything in the package sc.tyro.bundle) and to have only imports
from core (sc.tyro.core.component). The core package is like an Universal UI Domain definition.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Tyro provides by default the *HTML5* bundle to interact with basic HTML5 components - see <<Html5 - Tyro equivalence>>
