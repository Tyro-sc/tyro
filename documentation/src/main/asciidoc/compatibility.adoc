== Compatibility

Tyro is based on Selenium 3 and definitely turned to the future.
But for the moment all the vendor driver are not at the same level and it's an on going process.
We take care to be 100% compatible with all browser to offer you a full abstraction of Selenium. But for the moment only th 2 major browsers are supported :

==== Chrome

Fully compatible. We strongly encourage to use it as your default test Browser.

==== Firefox

Not fully - TODO (key modifiers ?)

1. Selenium Actions are not implemented see: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/233
2. FF don't have the focus on the browser when page is opened: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/394

In any case you can fallback to native webdriver like this:

[source, groovy]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WebDriver webdriver = config.evaluator.driver
