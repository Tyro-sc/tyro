Tyro is built on top of http://www.seleniumhq.org/[Selenium, role="external", window="_blank"],and works with Chrome and Firefox.
Even though Tyro provides an extra layer of convenience and productivity, it is always possible to "fallback" to the WebDriver level to do something directly, if you need to.

Tyro adds a powerful DSL, while maintaining the usage of Groovy and keeps the advantages of a strongly typed language.
