=== Dropdown

image::components/Dropdown.png[Dropdown]

"a *dropdown* allows the user to choose one value from a list. When a dropdown is inactive, it displays a
single value. When activated, it displays (drops down) a list of values, that can be eventually grouped by a theme, from which the user may select one.
When the user selects a new value, the control reverts to its inactive state, displaying the selected value."
