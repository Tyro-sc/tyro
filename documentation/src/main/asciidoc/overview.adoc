== Overview

'''

The goal of this document is to provide comprehensive reference documentation for developers who want to write User Interface tests with Tyro.
It also explains how to write Good UI tests scenarios.

=== Introduction

Tyro is a web user interface testing tool providing a framework to test any html5 application.
What makes it stand out from the crowd is its beautiful and highly expressive language.
Tyro provides, on one hand, an abstraction of the UI business domain through an expressive API and, on the other hand, a way to express this domain via a DSL (a button semantically stays a button, whatever the technology).
With Tyro, you can therefore write tests with a seldom achieved level of expressiveness and make those tests INDEPENDENT of the underlying technology.

Tyro is build on top of the https://www.selenium.dev/[WebDriver] browser automation library, which means that Tyro can work with any browser that WebDriver support.
Tyro plays very well with https://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit], https://cucumber.io/[Cucumber], https://gauge.org/[Gauge] et many others testing tools.

=== Why Tyro is unique

Tyro is the result of numerous real-world observations of developers in the trenches in the area of GUI testing.
Working for many years to promote the *TDD/BDD* approaches, we often faced difficulties in their implementation for the graphical layer of applications.

The *"TEST FIRST"* principle excludes all scenario recorder based approaches that only allow you to write "at posteriori" tests.
Our experience has taught us that this path is a dead-end.

Another problem is UI tests are brittle and costly! We do think that this is due to the lack of abstraction in existing UI testing tools.

Therefore, Tyro can transform tests in real assets, present throughout the life of the application and always in tune with the latest version of the application.

Tyro is an opinionated tool. It forces the user to see and use the domain layer as a composition and aggregation of UI components (in Tyro, everything is a UI component).

Tyro is a library to write functional tests. Functional tests means **SPECIFICATIONS**.

=== Philosophy

Tyro is a strongly opinionated tool. There is no anonymous "WebElement". Everything needs to be a *COMPONENT*.
Tyro is a typed UI component tool.

In the previous sample the line:
[source, groovy]
-----------------------------------------------------
TextField search = $('#lst-ib') as InputTypeText
-----------------------------------------------------
expressed that we try to find an *HTML5 input of type text with id: 'lst-ib'* but we want to use it
as a formal TextField

The associated imports are :
[source, groovy]
-----------------------------------------------------
import sc.tyro.core.component.field.TextField
import sc.tyro.bundle.html5.input.InputTypeText
-----------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
(TODO : a discuter) The challenge is to avoid imports on a bundle (everything in the package sc.tyro.bundle) and to have only imports
from core (sc.tyro.core.component). The core package is like an Universal UI Domain definition.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Tyro provides by default the *HTML5* bundle to interact with basic HTML5 components - see <<Html5 - Tyro equivalence>>

=== Design and Architecture

schema : TODO

Tyro is built on top of http://www.seleniumhq.org/[Selenium, role="external", window="_blank"],and works with Chrome and Firefox.
Even though Tyro provides an extra layer of convenience and productivity, it is always possible to "fallback" to the WebDriver level to do something directly, if you need to.

Tyro adds a powerful DSL, while maintaining the usage of Groovy and keeps the advantages of a strongly typed language.

=== Compatibility

Tyro is based on Selenium 3 and definitely turned to the future.
But for the moment all the vendor driver are not at the same level and it's an on going process.
We take care to be 100% compatible with all browser to offer you a full abstraction of Selenium. But for the moment only th 2 major browsers are supported :

==== Chrome

Fully compatible. We strongly encourage to use it as your default test Browser.

==== Firefox

Not fully - TODO (key modifiers ?)

1. Selenium Actions are not implemented see: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/233
2. FF don't have the focus on the browser when page is opened: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/394

In any case you can fallback to native webdriver like this:

[source, groovy]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WebDriver webdriver = config.evaluator.driver
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
