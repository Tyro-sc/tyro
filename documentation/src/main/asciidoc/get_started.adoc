== Getting started

=== Quick start from a template

*Tyro* comes with a https://github.com/Tyro-sc/tyro-starters[bunch of starters] for different combinations of testing tools (*JUnit4, JUni5, Cucumber...*).

These starters give you a good taste of the power and flexibility of *Tyro*.

== First examples

Let's have a look at some simple examples of *Tyro* use.

=== A simple specification test

A simple form like this :

image::sample_1.png[Specification,align="left"]

can be specified like this :

[source,groovy,linenums]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/test/groovy/sc/tyro/doc/SampleTest.groovy[tags=sample_1,indent=0]
----

=== A simple functional test

The check/uncheck behavior of the following choice :

image::sample_2.png[Functional,align="left"]

can be tested like this :

[source,groovy,linenums]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/test/groovy/sc/tyro/doc/SampleTest.groovy[tags=sample_2,indent=0]
----

== Functional vs Specification tests

In the UI test area you need to face with two type of tests: Functional tests and Specification tests.

=== The Functional tests

This type of tests describes the user intention.

For example:

    - As a user I want to log in my application
    - As a user I want to send a message

These tests focus on the interaction between the user and the UI.

In the case of a login scenario you want to describe something like :

    - User fills his my username.
    - User fills his password.
    - User clicks on login button.

Generally it's a black box testing.
You have a state before the action and a state after.
The well-known pattern on it is the famous https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)#Gherkin_language[Gherkin language] *Given-When-Then*

=== The Specification tests

This type of test describes the design language between the user and the application.

For example:

    - A field should be visible
    - A field should be disabled by default
    - A field should have expected label
    - ...

This type of tests are very useful to check the expected state of the screen.
