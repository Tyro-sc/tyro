== Tyro language

Tyro allows you to manipulate the User Interface and to interact with the components :

* by using the classical <<interactions>> with elements such as keyboard and mouse,
* or by using states, properties and intentions provided on each component.

=== States
Tyro components have *states* that can be tested with the function *'be'*  :

[NOTE]
====
*component.should { be _state_ }*

_examples_ :

- radio_button.should { be unchecked }

- text_field.should { be empty }

- form.should { be valid }

====

=== Properties
Tyro component have *properties* that can be tested with the function *'have'* :

[NOTE]
====
*component.should { have _property (xxxx)_ }*

_examples_ :

- first_button.should { have label ('Submit') }

- country_list.should { have selectedItem ('CANADA') }

- ident_text_field.should { have placeholder ('T999-9999') }

====
=== Intentions
Tyro components are linked to *intentions* that can be invoked :

[NOTE]
====
*_intention_ component*   _or_   *on component _intention xxxx_*

_examples_ :

- clear ident_text_field

- check radio_bouton

- on country_list select 'CANADA'
